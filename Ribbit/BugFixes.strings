Bug 1
-Set the Main.interface in deployment Info
Bug 2
-Removed constraint that was aligning the two buttons bottom constraints together
Bug 3
-Updated if statement in EditFriendsViewController.m to make sure it is not adding users to friends array twice
//else if (cell.accessoryType != UITableViewCellAccessoryCheckmark && ([self isFriend:user.username] == false)) {
//    cell.accessoryType = UITableViewCellAccessoryCheckmark;
//    [self.currentUser addFriend:user];
}
Bug 4
-Updated removeFriend method in User.m. Used removeObjectAtIndexPath instead of just removeObject. removeObject would not actually remove the user from the mutable array
-Updated isFriend method in EditFriendsViewController.m. Previously, contrainsObject was being used to see if a certain user was in the friends array. That method was checking against reference/pointer types rather than the value of the object so it was not picking up friends that were actually in the array.
Bug 5
-Ran the leaks instrument and did not find any leaks
Bug 6
-Updated all depricated APIs without changing functionality. Imported the AVKit.frameworks and AVFoundation.frameworks
